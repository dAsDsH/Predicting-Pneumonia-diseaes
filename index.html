                <h1>What is the Pneumonia? </h1>
                <span></span>
                <p>Pneumonia is a lung infection that causes inflammation and fluid buildup in the air sacs of the lungs. 
                    It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Pneumonia affects the respiratory system and can lead to symptoms such as coughing, 
                    chest discomfort, and difficulty breathing. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Treatment typically involves medication to target the specific cause of the infection, along with rest and supportive care. Pneumonia can vary in severity,
                    ranging from mild cases that can be managed at home to more severe cases that require hospitalization.</p>
